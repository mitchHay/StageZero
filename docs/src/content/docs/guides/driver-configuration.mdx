A big part of how `StageZero` works is via configuration, which is steered by [`WebDriverOptions`](/StageZero/reference/stagezero/web-driver-options)

## Providing a Driver with Options

You can configure your `IDriverWeb` instance by newing up a `WebDriverOptions` instance.

```csharp
var config = new WebDriverOptions();
var driver = DriverBuilder.Create(config);
```

### Targeting a Different Browser

Lets say you wanted to run your tests against `Firefox`. To do so, you can change your target browser in the `WebDriverOptions` like so:

```csharp
var config = new WebDriverOptions
{
    Browser = Browser.Firefox
};
```

### Targeting a Mobile Device

So you want to test against a mobile sized viewport? You can do so (only in Chrome and Edge) by providing the following config:

```csharp
var config = new WebDriverOptions
{
    EmulatedDeviceName = Device.IPhone12Pro
};
```

For a full list of supported options to provide your `IDriverWeb` instance, please head to the [`WebDriverOptions`](/StageZero/reference/stagezero/web-driver-options) documentation.
