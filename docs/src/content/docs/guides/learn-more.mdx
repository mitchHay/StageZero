StageZero is an automated UI testing library for the web that allows you to use whatever underlying WebDriver you wish to steer the browser.

It's all about giving you flexibility, focus, and an awesome developer experience.
Want to change to a different UI testing framework (e.g. Selenium -> Playwright)? 
You can with **next to no refactoring required** in your codebase. 
Tired of writing and maintaining methods to steer and control browser state?
StageZero handles that for you so you can **completely focus on writing your automated tests**. No more managing/maintaining in-house frameworks.
