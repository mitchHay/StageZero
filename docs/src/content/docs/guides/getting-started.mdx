## Installing StageZero

In order to use `StageZero` you must first install the core package, as well as your desired framework integration.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Core">
        ```sh
        dotnet add package StageZero
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Playwright">
        ```sh
        dotnet add package StageZero.Playwright
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Selenium">
        ```sh
        dotnet add package StageZero.Selenium
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Registering a DriverBuilder

Once you've installed all the required packages, you must register your desired framework integration with our `DriverBuilder`. Don't worry, this only has to be done once! 
For example, if you're wanting to use our one of our integrations with `NUnit` you can do:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Selenium">
        ```csharp
        using StageZero.Selenium;

        namespace Your.Namespace;

        [SetUpFixture]
        public class GlobalSetup
        {
            [OneTimeSetUp]
            public class BeforeEverything()
            {
                DriverBuilder.Register<WebDriverBuilder>();
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Playwright">
        ```csharp
        using StageZero.Playwright;

        namespace Your.Namespace;

        [SetUpFixture]
        public class GlobalSetup
        {
            [OneTimeSetUp]
            public class BeforeEverything()
            {
                DriverBuilder.Register<WebDriverBuilder>();
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's all the setup code you'll ever have to write. Now onto writing our first test!

## Writing a Test

`StageZero` handles all of the underlying logic required to create, navigate, interact with elements, and terminate drivers. All you have to do is write your test, no more managing frameworks!

Following on from the example provided above, you can write a test for the web like:

```csharp
public class Test
{
    private IDriverWeb _driver;

    [SetUp]
    public void BeforeEach()
    {
        _driver = DriverBuilder.Create(new WebDriverOptions());
    }

    [Test]
    public Task NavigateToGoogle()
    {
        await _driver.Navigate().ToUrl("https://google.com");
    }

    [TearDown]
    public Task AfterEach()
    {
        await _driver.Terminate();
    }
}
```

## Running a Test

Because `StageZero` is built on the `dotnet` framework, all you have to do is run `dotnet test ./path/to/yourproj.csproj`. 
Alternatively, if you're using an IDE you should be able to run your created test in that IDE's integrated test runner.

## Done ðŸŽ‰

Pat yourself on the back! You've just written your first test!
