`StageZero` follows a similar approach to interacting with alerts to the likes of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/dialogs) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.dialog). You can subscribe to the `OnAlert` event listener
available in the `IDriverWeb` object. This allows you to have clear, concise alert handling and reduces the requirement for having to wait for an alert to appear in the browser.

## Usage

```csharp
var driver = DriverBuilder.Create(new WebDriverOptions());
driver.OnAlert += async (_, alert) => 
{
    // Handle any alert based actions here.
};
```

> ⚠️ **Precautions**
>
> You must ensure that you handle the alert directly in the `OnAlert` event handler. If you do not call either `Dismiss` or `Confirm` your tests **will** hang.

### Confirming an alert


```csharp
driver.OnAlert += async (_, alert) => 
{
    await alert.Confirm();
};
```

### Dismissing an alert

```csharp
driver.OnAlert += async (_, alert) => 
{
    await alert.Dismiss();
};
```

### Getting alert text

```csharp
driver.OnAlert += async (_, alert) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine(alert.Message);
    await alert.Dismiss();
}
```
