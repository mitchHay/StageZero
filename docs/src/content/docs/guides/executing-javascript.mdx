Sometimes it's necessary to execute JavaScript directly in the browser from your tests. 
`StageZero` supplies a variety of utility commands to achieve this across our support WebDrivers.

## Running JavaScript

```csharp title="Test.cs"
var js = "console.log('Hello world!');";
await driver.Document().ExecuteJavaScript(js);
```

## Retrieving an object using JavaScript

```csharp title="Test.cs"
var js = "return document.location.href;";
var href = await driver.Document().ExecuteJavaScript<string>(js);
```
