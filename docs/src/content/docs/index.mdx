## Supported WebDrivers

Use `StageZero` with any of the listed WebDrivers.

<SupportedDrivers />

**WebDriver not there?**

`StageZero` is completely open-source, so if you want to add support for another WebDriver you can contribute [here](https://github.com/mitchHay/StageZero/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## The TLDR;

Want to cut straight to the chase? Here are some of the main reasons to start using `StageZero`.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Heightened focus" icon="open-book">
		StageZero is all about focusing on what matters, your tests! Focus on test creation, rather than writing and maintaining logic to steer the browser.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Write tests once" icon="puzzle">
		Build your tests with confidence. You can migrate to and from an integration of your choosing with ease. We don't punish you for changing WebDriver technology.*
	</Card>
  <Card title="Minimal setup" icon="document">
    Register your desired integration with our `DriverBuilder` and away you go. No more creating or maintaining separate framework code. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Streamlined interactions" icon="random">
    It's never been easier to interact with elements. Execute a variety of actions with the call of a method.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple configuration" icon="setting">
    Control any desired WebDriver behaviours (e.g. headless mode) with our `DriverOptions` configuration. We handle the rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rock solid" icon="rocket">
    All supported integrations are built with stability and parallelism in mind. Feel comfortable knowing you're on strong foundations.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
