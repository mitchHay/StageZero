## The TLDR;

Want to cut straight to the chase? Here are some of the main reasons to start using `StageZero`.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Agnostic first" icon="puzzle">
		Build your tests with confidence. You can migrate to and from an integration of your choosing (e.g. Selenium -> Playwright) with only one line of code. Your tests will always work.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Minimal setup" icon="document">
        Register your desired integration with our `DriverBuilder` and away you go. No more creating or maintaining separate framework code. StageZero allows you to focus on test creation, rather than browser interaction.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Lightweight interactions" icon="random">
        It's never been easier to interact with elements. Execute a variety of actions with the call of a method.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Interoperable configuration" icon="setting">
        Many integrations, one configuration instance. You only need to deal with our `DriverOptions` in order to change test driver behaviours. We handle the rest.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Rock solid" icon="rocket">
        All supported integrations are built with stability and parallelism in mind. Feel comfortable knowing you're on strong foundations.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>
